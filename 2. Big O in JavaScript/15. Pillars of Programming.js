// Pillars of Programming:

/* Now at this situation, we can say that a good code must have two properties: 
    1. Readable
    2. Scalable

But there are two parts of Scalable properties. And they are 
    1. Speed / Time Complexity
    2. Memory / Space Complexity
*/

// So, Pillars of our programming are : 
    // 1. Readable
    // 2. Speed / Time Complexity
    // 3. Memory / Time Complexity
