// Hash tables in different languages:

/*
    Normally, in javascript, any type of data can be stored or can be the value of the hash tables, like string, array, 
    numeric or function or boolean.
    But as i mentioned before that, normally or in generally, in javascript, string type data can be only the key.

    And now, here is news that, in modern js or es6, there are two new features, which helps us to beak down our this problems.
    They are:
        1. Map
        2. Sets

    1.Map:
        syntax: const a = new Map();
    
    there is two benefits of using map,
        first one is, using map, we can use any data type as our key in hash table.
        second one is, in hash table, there stored data unorderly. But using map, it helps us to store 
        data in a ordered way.

    2. Sets:
        Syntax: const b = new Sets();

    using sets, we can only store keys of an hash table, no values.
