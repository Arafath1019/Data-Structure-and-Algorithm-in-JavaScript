//what is algorithm?

/*
    An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a problem.

    Data structures + Algorithms = Great Programs

    that means, 

        class{} + functions() = programs
*/

//Recursive Function:

/*
    The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called recursive function.

    For example:

        function recursive(){
            recursive();
        }
*/

//Stack-overflow:

/*
    A stack-overflow is an undesirable conditions in which a particular computer program tries to use memory space than the call stack has available.
*/

//Base case or stop point of a recursive function:

/*
    Every recursive function has mainly two path, and they are:
    `1. calling the function again again for the recursion
    2. For stopping recursion process, add a base case in the recursive function.
