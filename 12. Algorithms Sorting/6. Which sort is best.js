// Which sort is best?

/*
    1. If the input is very small or mostly sorted, then we can use insertion sort.
    2. For any input to require a fast program, then we can use Merge Sort, but the space complexity of the merge sort is quite bigger.
    3. And if the requirement is less space complexity, then we can use Quick sort though its time complexity is little bit higher than merge sort but space complexity is less than merge sort.
*/

//There are two types of sorting technique
/*
    1. Comparison Sort
        1. Bubble sort
        2. insertion sort
        3. selection sort
        4. merge sort
        5. quick sort

    2. Non-comparison sort
        1. Counting sort
        2. Radix sort

        //non-comparison sorting time complexity is less than comparison sort, but this type of sorting is only appropriate on the integer type data structure, others type of data cant to be sorted using non-comparison sorting.
