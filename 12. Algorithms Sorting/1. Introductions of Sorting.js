// The issue with sort() method comes from the every languages:

/*
    Sort() method comes from every language, but in different different languages, this sort() method is implemented in different different way, so the efficiency is not a stable term for this. Beside this for every type of data structure, this commonly provided sort() coming form every languages, can't sort every time, like if the input value is only a few or small, or some in fixed data type this sort() method can perform well, otherwise it breaks the sorting process and can't able to sort them well. And this are the most commonly faces issues which are coming form sort() method.
