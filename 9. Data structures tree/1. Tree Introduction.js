// Tree Data structures:

/*

*/

// Binary tree

/*
    A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children generally referred as left child and right child.

    Binary tree is two types, 
        1. Perfect Binary tree
        2. Full binary tree
*/

// Properties for perfect binary tree

/*
    1. Total nodes number of a level is equal to the double of previous level total nodes number
    2.Total nodes number of a level is equal to all the nodes of all level + 1.
